# List of Features in the Mini-C Interpreter:

- [x] Parameterized functions with local variables.
- [x] Recursion.
- [x] The IF statement.
- [x] The DO-WHILE, WHILE, and FOR loops.
- [x] int and char variables.
- [x] Global variables.
- [x] int and char constants.
- [x] String constants (limited implementation).
- [x] The return statement, with or without a value.
- [x] A limited number of standard library functions.
- [x] These operators: +, -, *, %, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, unary - and unary +.
- [x] Parentheses support.
- [x] Functions returning integers.
- [x] Comments.
- [ ] Refactor syntax and lexical analyzer.
- [ ] Example programs to demonstrate Mini-C.
