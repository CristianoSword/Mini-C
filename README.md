Description:
  A C interpreter implementing a subset of C instructions with support for
  functions, recursion, control structures, and basic data types.
  Designed for educational purposes and lightweight C code execution.

## Feature List in the Mini-C Interpreter:
- [x] Parameterized functions with local variables.
- [x] Recursion.
- [x] The IF statement.
- [x] DO-WHILE, WHILE and FOR loops.
- [x] Int and char variables.
- [x] Global variables.
- [x] Int and char constants.
- [x] String constants (limited implementation).
- [x] The return statement, with or without value.
- [x] A limited number of standard library functions.
- [x] These operators: +, -, *, %, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, unary - and unary +.
- [x] Support for parentheses.
- [x] Functions returning integers.
- [x] Comments.
- [ ] Refactor syntax and lexical analyzer.
- [ ] Example programs to demonstrate Mini-C.

## Restrictions:
- The Switch statement will not be implemented.
- The IF, WHILE, DO and FOR statements must be enclosed in code blocks with braces.
